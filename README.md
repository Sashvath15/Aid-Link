# Aid- Link
 Platform for donations and requests during natural disasters.

Product Overview

Empowering Indigenous communities by creating a lifeline during times of natural disaster, our initiative connects those affected by floods, droughts, and other crises with individuals and organizations eager to extend a helping hand. We focus on bridging the gap between people in urgent need of food, water, shelter, and essential supplies with compassionate donors who wish to make a meaningful difference.
By integrating local knowledge, resilience, and technology, we foster a network where care and support flow directly to where it’s most needed—bringing hope and humanity to the forefront of disaster relief.
