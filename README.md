# Aid- Link
 Platform for donations and requests during natural disasters.

Product Overview

Empowering Indigenous communities by creating a lifeline during natural disasters, our initiative connects those affected by floods, droughts, and other crises with individuals and organizations eager to extend a helping hand. We focus on bridging the gap between people in urgent need of food, water, shelter, and essential supplies and compassionate donors who wish to make a meaningful difference.
By integrating local knowledge, resilience, and technology, we foster a network in which care and support flow directly to where theyâ€™re most needed, bringing hope and humanity to the forefront of disaster relief.

Steps to Run The Project:

1) Install all necessary Python libraries.
2) Run the command mongod in the command prompt.
3) Run all three python files (donate_update.py, request_update.py, view_update.py) in separate terminals (eg: python filename.py).
4) Run frontend.html by opening it with live server.
